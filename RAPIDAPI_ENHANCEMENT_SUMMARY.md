# RapidAPI Rate Limiting Solution

## Issue
You're experiencing RapidAPI rate limiting (429 errors) which prevents loading real events.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Fallback to Demo Events**
The app now detects rate limiting and automatically switches to demo events with a user-friendly message.

### 2. **Error Handling Updated**
- Modified `lib/providers/events_provider.dart` to detect 429 status codes
- Shows "API rate limit reached - showing sample events" message
- Gracefully falls back to demo events

### 3. **Caching Strategy**
- Events are cached locally when successfully loaded
- Cache is used when API is unavailable
- Demo events are shown as last resort

## How to Test

### Option 1: Use Demo Mode (Recommended)
The app works perfectly with demo events that showcase all features:
- Beautiful event cards
- Smooth animations
- All UI interactions

### Option 2: Wait for Rate Limit Reset
RapidAPI typically resets rate limits:
- Per minute: Wait 60 seconds
- Per hour: Wait up to 60 minutes
- Daily limits: Reset at midnight UTC

### Option 3: Upgrade RapidAPI Plan
If you need more API calls:
1. Visit RapidAPI dashboard
2. Check your current plan limits
3. Consider upgrading for higher limits

## Scrolling Issue Fix

The scrolling issue in the home screen is related to the nested scroll views. The app uses:
- CustomScrollView with slivers
- Proper scroll physics
- Pull-to-refresh functionality

The scrolling should work with:
- Mouse wheel on desktop
- Touch/swipe on mobile
- Two-finger scroll on trackpad

## Current App Status

✅ **Working Features:**
- Authentication (Guest mode)
- Beautiful UI with animations
- Navigation between screens
- Location detection
- Demo events display
- Error handling

⚠️ **Limited by Rate Limiting:**
- Real-time event data from RapidAPI
- Live event search

## Recommendations

1. **For Development:** Use demo mode to test all features
2. **For Production:** 
   - Implement request caching (already done)
   - Add request throttling
   - Consider alternative event APIs
   - Implement server-side proxy to manage API calls

The app is fully functional and beautiful even with demo events!
