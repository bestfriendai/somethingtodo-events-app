- **Mapbox Token:** Missing/invalid configuration

---

## Configuration Issues

### Critical Configuration Problems
1. **API Keys Missing:**
   - RapidAPI key: Placeholder value
   - Mapbox access token: Missing/invalid

2. **Firebase Configuration:**
   - Security rules too restrictive for favorites functionality
   - Proper authentication flow needed

3. **Dependency Versions:**
   - `flutter_local_notifications` incompatibility
   - `desugar_jdk_libs` version mismatch

4. **Hive Database:**
   - EventVenue adapter not registered
   - Blocking offline caching functionality

## Recommendations for Production Deployment

### üî¥ Critical (Must Fix Before Deployment)

1. **Fix Android Build Issue**
   ```gradle
   // Update android/app/build.gradle
   android {
       compileOptions {
           coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
       }
   }
   dependencies {
       coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.1.4'
   }
   ```

2. **Register Hive Adapters**
   ```dart
   // In main.dart or cache service initialization
   Hive.registerAdapter(EventVenueAdapter());
   ```

3. **Configure External APIs**
   - Set up valid RapidAPI key
   - Configure Mapbox access token
   - Update Firebase security rules

4. **Fix UI Layout Issues**
   - Address RenderFlex overflow in event cards
   - Test on various screen sizes

### üü° Important (Should Fix Before Launch)

1. **Implement Comprehensive Testing**
   - No test directory found - add unit, widget, and integration tests
   - Test offline scenarios thoroughly
   - Validate error recovery paths

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile memory usage under load
   - Optimize image caching strategies
   - Monitor API rate limiting effectiveness

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Add loading states for all async operations
   - Improve error messages for network failures
   - Test accessibility features

### üü¢ Nice to Have (Post-Launch)

1. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Set up proper crash reporting
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Add user behavior analytics

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Push notifications setup
   - Advanced search capabilities
   - Social features enhancement
