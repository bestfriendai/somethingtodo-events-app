# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT üö®

## API Keys Found in Version Control

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: This repository previously contained hardcoded API keys in the following file:
- `functions/set-config.sh`

## What Was Fixed

1. **Removed hardcoded API keys** from the configuration script
2. **Updated script** to use environment variables instead
3. **Added validation** to ensure keys are set before deployment

## Security Recommendations

### 1. Revoke Compromised Keys
**IMMEDIATELY** revoke and regenerate the following API keys:
- OpenAI API Key (starts with `sk-ant-api03-...`)
- RapidAPI Key (`92bc1b4fc7mshacea9f118bf7a3fp1b5a6cjsnd2287a72fcb9`)

### 2. Update Configuration
Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_new_openai_key"
export RAPIDAPI_KEY="your_new_rapidapi_key"

# Run the configuration script
cd functions
./set-config.sh
```

### 3. Git History Cleanup
Consider cleaning the Git history to remove the exposed keys:

```bash
# Use git-filter-repo or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove sensitive data
# This is especially important if this repository is public
```

### 4. Security Best Practices Going Forward

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
- **Use .env files** for local development (and add them to .gitignore)
- **Use Firebase Functions config** for production deployment
- **Regularly rotate API keys**
- **Monitor API usage** for unauthorized access

## Current Security Status

‚úÖ **Fixed**: Hardcoded keys removed from configuration script
‚úÖ **Fixed**: Environment variable validation added
‚ö†Ô∏è  **Action Required**: Revoke and regenerate exposed API keys
‚ö†Ô∏è  **Action Required**: Update production configuration with new keys
